        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
          The rapidly increasing relevance of computers in our society’s evolution is nowhere clearer than within the
          art world. Digital technology has transformed many aspects of art and provided artists with a vast array of
          tools for both its creation as well as allowing new methods of interaction by their audience. This rise of
          constantly developing computers has triggered a response which questions whether they can produce art
          autonomously and if this process can truly be considered creative. To answer this question, the concept of
          creativity must first be analysed to allow for a more thorough understanding of how our human experiences can
          be compared to those of a computer. I will explore the work of multiple artists operating in this field
          alongside their approach to the concept of artificial intelligence in art, followed by a final discussion on
          the implications of creative machines including the positive potential that they have, the inherent public
          resistance and reluctance to embrace this and the question of whether the creativity of a computer should
          constitute AI art being considered its own art movement rather than a mere art-making tool. The thought of
          robots creating art by employing their own intelligence was once only feasible in the realms of
          science-fiction, yet today there is an exciting emergent AI art scene producing results not previously
          considered possible.

        <h2>AI ART SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the name given to computer software with the ability to perform actions that
          are appropriate to achieve a goal within a given context. An AI should be flexible to allow for changing
          environments and objectives as well as the ability to learn from experience, letting it make decisions
          fitting the limitations in its perception and computation. This all amounts to a computer with a form of
          intelligence akin to the human understanding of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI art is the term for the manipulation of this technology by artists often with the goal of creating and
          discovering new approaches and aesthetics not yet realised by humans. Most commonly, the computer uses a
          human-defined input to form an understanding of techniques or visual cues and begins to adapt them into a new
          composition. Due to their nature, AI’s have the potential to surpass the human artist in various
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rise of AI art is a natural evolution of generative art, a technique involving the use of automated
          systems that can independently determine elements of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made
          by the artist. By using algorithms, certain elements of a generative work can be randomised – an integral
          component of the process. This is appealing to artists as they can define specific aspects of a work
          themselves and leave other elements for the computer to determine, a process that produces works shaped by
          the artist but with enough random factors to surprise them. Additionally, a different outcome is formed every
          time the software is activated, potentially allowing viewers to experience an entirely unique iteration of a
          work at every viewing. This mesh of artist expertise and computer processing could be considered a
          collaboration between the artist and computer due to the similar levels in which both impact the end result.
          Eventually, these generative programs became complex enough that they were considered AI – abandoning the
          random elements of the program for new logical solutions.

        <h2>COMPUTERS AND CREATIVITY</h2>
        <p>
          Before determining whether computers can be creative, the definition of creativity must be specified.
          Unfortunately, this is not a simple task due to the ambiguous nature of the term, leaving much room to
          theorise. In the Creativity Research Journal’s article ‘The Standard Definition of Creativity’, Runco and
          Jaeger discuss the two commonly proposed criteria required for creativity: originality and effectiveness.
          They confirm the necessity of these principles, stating:
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="quote">
            “Originality is undoubtedly required. It is often labelled novelty, but whatever the label, if something is
            not unusual, novel, or unique, it is commonplace, mundane, or conventional. It is not original, and
            therefore not creative.
            <br /><br />
            Originality is vital for creativity but is not sufficient. Ideas and products that are merely original
            might very well be useless. They may be unique or uncommon for good reason! …A truly random process will
            often generate something that is merely original.” (Runco & Jaeger, 2012)
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          These principles are an important step towards interpreting the notion of creativity but cannot be considered
          an outright answer. Within the art world, it is easy to understand the requirement of originality in a work
          of art to recognise it as creative and yet approaching the subject with the criteria of appropriateness or
          worthiness is not possible due to its subjective nature. There is no defining gauge establishing what ‘art’
          is, thus enabling boundaries to be challenged and broken in order to allow for something new to emerge. This,
          however, makes designating an artwork as creative seem like a fundamentally impossible task. It is due to
          this that many artists reject the idea that computers can be creative, as the notion of a computer possessing
          individuality – a characteristic considered profoundly human – is thought to be illogical and absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, however, is not the exclusive definition of creativity. In his article ‘The Rise of Storytelling
          Machines’, literary scholar Jonathan Gottschall suggests creativity is derived from the “process of
          immersion, assimilation, and recombination” (Gottschall, 2015). This definition is more applicable in the art
          world as it can be easily paralleled in the work of historical fine artists where influences are often
          overtly evident and the artistic development can be followed by the viewer. This adoption of influences from
          other motifs and works of art is what is usually commended as creative, a procedure that is entirely possible
          for a computer to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of a monumental moment in the field of creative AI occurred during the 2016 Go contest between
          grandmaster Lee Sedol and AlphaGo – Google’s artificially intelligent Go-playing machine. Go is a Chinese
          originated game with simple rules but an astounding complexity. It boasts 10<sup>170</sup> possible board
          combinations –
          more than the number of atoms in the known universe, causing the game to be infamously difficult for AI’s to
          play. A single move during the tournament, the 37<sup>th</sup> in the second game of this historic matchup,
          shocked
          everyone spectating and caused Sedol to stand up and leave the room. Even upon his return, Sedol remained
          dumbfounded and spent nearly 15 minutes considering his next play, eventually losing the match after a
          downward spiral triggered by the move. This was a move that was completely unexpected, a fact that becomes
          more impressive when you consider the 2500-4000-year history of the game and it fundamentally changed the way
          people now play Go. Considering the two definitions of creativity I’ve analysed, this move is considered
          creative. It was both original and effective, and was achieved via a process of immersion, assimilation and
          recombination: AlphaGo studied many strong amateur games to expand its knowledge on typical human play and
          used this to play itself thousands of times, learning from its mistakes and slowly improving until it became
          strong enough to beat a grandmaster. Referring to AlphaGo’s play, artist and researcher Mike Tyka stated,
          “The moves were subsequently studied and described as 'beautiful" by expert human players. That sounds like
          the machine had created something novel, surprising and of value; to me that's creativity.” (Tyka, cited in
          Goldstaub, 2018)
        </p>
        <p>
          If we consider that computers can be creative, why is it that audiences are so often decidedly resistant
          towards AI art, or at the very least unsure? Perhaps when an audience is averse to the notion of creative
          output by a computer, it is in fact another element that they feel is missing from the work such as a
          familiar connection to the artist who created it – an empathy that humans struggle to place upon machines. I
          believe that when an audience learns that no feeling or genuine emotion was used to create a work, its
          perception changes which causes it to appear impersonal and alien to them.

        <h2>HAROLD COHEN</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most influential artists to have explored creative computing was British artist Harold Cohen, who
          in the 1960s and 70s was inspired by the emerging tendency of his fellow fine artists to begin teaching
          themselves how to program to prevent their reliance on computer programmer collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a year-long visit at the Institute of Arts at the University of California in 1968, Cohen started
          exploring the use of programming to create a painting machine and after numerous attempts and experiments, he
          completed the first iteration of a computer program he named AARON. AARON was titled as such due to its
          inaugural nature and Cohens desire to begin his series of works at the letter A, an idea that was ultimately
          unnecessary as it remained the only major program he ever worked on until his death in 2016. This visit
          resulted in Cohen being granted the rank of professor, prompting him to stay at the institute for nearly
          three decades, during which AARON’s development never halted. In fact, Cohen never stopped expanding AARON’s
          capabilities, introducing many advancements and improvements throughout the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          AARON’s initial program was uncomplex – Cohen defined a small set of regulations and forms that he used to
          control a drawing “turtle”. This was a small, manoeuvrable robot with a marker attached that slid across a
          surface and touched pen to paper according to the algorithm written by Cohen. In its early years, AARON could
          only produce these monochrome abstract drawings, which were then hand-coloured by Cohen. By the 1980’s,
          however, the program could produce some real-world shapes, including foliage and human figures. In 1983,
          Cohen claimed that AARON’s code was similar in length to that of a short novel and described it as an expert
          system: a program that has access to the knowledge of an expert in its field and can perform in a similar way
          to the expert. AARON was designed to mimic a human painting style, using techniques comparable to traditional
          artists that formed visually comparable work. This was Cohen’s original goal when creating it: rather than a
          machine that produced alien compositions, he wanted AARON’s work to sit comfortably within the art world,
          considering himself a teacher in this process.
        </p>
        <figure class="figure" id="figure-1">
          <img src="media/cohen.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 1">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"><a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="#figures">Figure 1</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          An example of AARON’s work from this time is ‘03035-3’, a digital print composed of organic twisting shapes
          and the vivid colours synonymous with its works. Rather than a collection of discordant shapes and colours
          many expect from a computer, the work is coherent with consistency in its colour range and includes
          recognisable floral shapes. With a height of 28cm and width of 21.8cm, the prints small size invites the
          audience to view it up close, allowing them to examine its intricate details in full. Cohen’s choice of title
          for this work speaks of his view’s regarding it, the string of numbers implying a blatant dehumanisation of
          AARON. This can also be seen in his insistence of display labels and image credits reading ‘Digital print by
          AARON, a computer program written by Harold Cohen’, making the work’s AI origins clear. Despite this, he
          still gave primary credit to AARON – perhaps he was unwilling to name the piece himself as doing so would
          take away the works unmediated nature, choosing instead to grant it the purely practical name provided by
          AARON.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to creativity, Cohen wrote his thoughts on its definition in a Tate Gallery publication in 1982: “…it is
          marked by a rather strong disposition towards the reconstruction of beliefs: that is to say, I suspect that
          where most of us externalise in order to confirm what we think, the creative individual externalises in order
          to test, and consequently to restructure, belief.” (Tate Gallery, 1983, p. 11) He thought that the secret to
          creativity lay in the ability to adapt one’s understanding through one’s experience, constantly allowing
          one’s worldview to evolve. Considering the way Cohen deemed AARON a pupil of his, it becomes clear that the
          teaching of new artistic methods to his AI resembles the cultivation of a creative student. AARON’s
          development of the ability to decide which colours are appropriate demonstrates this as Cohen never
          explicitly told it what colours to use, instead teaching colour theory and allowing AARON to make the
          decision. It was this intelligence that allowed the AI to generate compositions Cohen had never imagined
          before, an aspect that became the most fascinating part of AARON to him. Soon after staring work on AARON,
          Cohen stated,

        </p>
        <div class="quote-blue">
          “Up to this point the computer has existed for the artist only as a somewhat frightening, but
          essentially trivial toy. When it becomes clear to him that the computer is, in fact, an abstract machine of
          great power, a general-purpose tool capable of delimiting his mind as other machines delimit him physically,
          then its use will be inevitable.” (Cohen, 1974)

        <h2>SOUGWEN CHUNG </h2>
        <p>
          An example of an artist exploring the possibilities of AI in a contemporary context is artist and researcher
          Sougwen Chung, a Chinese-born, Canadian-raised artist with an interest in the ways humans and computers
          interact. The primary way Chung utilises AI is through real time collaboration: she considers her work a
          joint effort between artist and computer, suggesting a connection between both when forming an art work. She
          draws in real time with a robot – often in the shape of a mechanical arm or ‘turtle’ device similar to those
          of Cohen’s drawing machines – allowing for some creative dialogue between the two and the building of an
          organic alliance while they work.
        </p>
        <figure class="figure" id="figure-2">
          <video class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" controls>
            <source src='media/sougwen.mp4' type='video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Chung’s ‘Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 2’ project introduced memory into her algorithms for the first
          time, resulting in a more nuanced collaboration than her previous foray into robotic teamwork that involved
          the simple mimicking of Chung’s movement. This allowed the AI to let Chung’s decisions inform its own and
          vice-versa, exhibiting a mutual synergy with this technique rather than the master-servant relationship
          usually inherent in the AI art medium. The method of teaching that arose from this is not unlike the
          previously mentioned procedure used by Cohen, adopting a humanlike style of teaching techniques as opposed to
          giving direct commands. Chung’s approach exceeds this however, allowing her to learn from the AI’s methods
          simultaneously to it learning from hers. Chung is an example of how artists can use AI not just to create
          standalone art, but to enhance their practice, learn new techniques and create something ground-breaking
          through human and computer collaboration. “Being able to engage with mark-making in collaboration with a
          robot means not always knowing what I’m doing—and that has been really enlightening.” (Chung, 2018)
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, Chung consistently places herself within the creation process, interested in the ways that
          humans interact with machines and their potential to enhance an artist’s practice rather than exploring
          entirely AI-driven work. Chung sees AI as a method of discovering more about herself and ourselves as human
          beings rather than a simple art-making tool. In an interview about her Human-Robotic collaborations, she
          stated “I’m compelled by the human capacity to anthropomorphize our relationship to machines, particularly to
          robots, and how that can end up being a mirror for how we view ourselves and our own interactions with
          others.” (Chung, 2018) This connection to machines has been amplified by the rapid progress made in
          fabricating computers that think in a similar way to humans. When technology gains the capability to be
          creative, it causes humans to think differently about their own creativity and explore it in angles not
          previously considered. Within the same interview, Chung mentions a quote by the late American writer Adrienne
          Rich from her book ‘Arts of the Possible: Essays and Conversations’: “Our senses are currently whip-driven by
          a feverish new pace of technological change. The activities that mark us as human, though, don’t begin, exist
          in, or end by such a calculus.” (Rich, 2002, p. 1) Chung suggests that back in 2002 the activities that mark
          us as
          human were much easier to separate from those of a computer, a separation that no longer remains as clear as
          it once did, and the same separation discussed earlier regarding creativity.

        <h2>GAN ARTISTS</h2>
        <p>
          On the cutting edge of AI technology, artists are training AI to create uncanny paintings by feeding them
          thousands of images to demonstrate a style and prompting them to display their own approximation. This is a
          technique that takes advantage of a ‘generative adversarial network’ (GAN), a system of two programs working
          in tandem. The term ‘adversarial’ stems from the bipartite nature of these algorithms: one generates images
          and the other is taught to judge these outputs and deem which are most appropriate. The <i>generator</i>
          network
          creates compositions by trying to discover what characteristics of a series of images constitute as integral
          to the chosen subject matter - the reverse of an image classifying program. These attempts at recreating the
          essentials of a defined set of images are then evaluated against the rating system of the <i>discriminator</i>
          network, where submissions that fail to be rated highly enough are fed back into the generator to adjust it
          and resubmit in rapid succession. The result of this process is an output that the computer considers
          matching to the aesthetics of the image set to a predetermined degree of quality.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          An example of this process can be seen the creation of ‘La Comtesse de Belamy’, a GAN-generated artwork by
          Paris-based AI art trio <i>Obvious</i>. This video shows a series of outputs by their GAN trained on a set of
          historical portraits, starting with images generated early in the process with little to no resemblance to
          the human form and letting the viewer experience their evolution towards a final work that the computer
          considered authentic enough. The compelling element of ‘La Comtesse de Belamy’ is the fact that despite its
          visual familiarity due to its composition, colours and tones, the work displays a woman that has never
          existed, making it completely unique.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Another individual using a GAN to generate portraits is German artist Mario Klingemann, who won major global
          digital arts ‘The Lumen Prize’ Gold Award in 2018 with the work ‘The Butchers Son’. Considered by Klingemann
          as the interpretation of the human form by a neural network, it presents a disfigured humanoid body with
          features seemingly contorted in pain. The formulation process of this work had several stages starting with a
          stick figure developed from more than 150,000 human poses that was then manipulated by a GAN to form a
          simplistic composition. To create the final aesthetic, another GAN was used to supplement it with details and
          textures. Despite the GAN’s discrimination ability, Klingemann made the final curatorial choice and picked
          the variation that spoke to him the most from a list of thousands, a task he executed himself due to the
          abstract nature of the work - he didn’t want the works visual qualities to comply with a pre-existing
          aesthetic so he was unable to teach the AI how to determine the most applicable solution. Klingemann exploits
          the GAN’s capability to generate imitations of the inputted data set to create oddities within the final work
          with the goal of subverting the AI’s primary characteristics. In an interview about his techniques,
          Klingemann comments regarding this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="quote-blue">
            “The most interesting stuff usually happens if the model is outside its defined range of values or pushed
            into areas it was not trained for. But it needs to be a deliberate decision. It allows me to explore
            different visual worlds and allows me to discover something that is aesthetically pleasing or disturbing –
            it’s a constant battle I fight.” (Klingemann, 2018)
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where <i>Obvious</i> use a GAN to try and replicate a style, Klingemann chooses to manipulate the creation
          process
          resulting in the formation of a new style.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Programmer and artist Helena Sarin utilises the same technology in yet another way: by using her own drawings
          and photographs to train a GAN, she remixes her works to create abstract compositions that still reflect the
          characteristics of her traditional art. The result of this process can be seen in the diptych ‘#PrettyInGAN’,
          part of her ongoing series ‘A Game of Construction’. Floral and facial elements can be identified within the
          work, but they appear warped and transformed by the GAN with unnatural colours and textures replacing what
          were once organic. Both sections of the work contain substantially different forms with the left
          incorporating an intricate design while the right has more blocky shapes. Despite this, a sense of unity is
          created throughout due to a consistency in colour and line quality. The AI’s ability to merge visually
          dissimilar images into a single cohesive work that still retains the styles of its origins, allowing Sarin to
          experiment with the creation of compositions that have a unique aesthetic while remaining recognisably hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As postulated in my previous analysis, the process followed by a GAN can be considered creative. It may be
          restricted to learn only from existing images, but it manipulates them into original compositions that are
          visually coherent and relevant – rather than random combinations, the AI produces work with a discernible end
          goal as set by the discriminator network. Not only can a GAN be considered creative, it can also be utilised
          in a creative manner by artists such as Klingemann’s in his generation of abstractions within a recognisable
          form and Sarin’s production of new works derived from her traditional art.

        <h2>IMPLICATIONS</h2>
        <p>
          After exploring numerous artist’s application of AI to produce work, how will this contemporary technology
          affect the art world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, can AI art be considered an art movement rather than simply a tool to augment an artist’s work?
          Regarding my previous analysis of AI creativity, the conclusion resulted in the fact that yes, AI could be
          considered creative therefore legitimising its work as creative too. Accordingly, it seems appropriate to
          label these works that are produced in an original manner with unique aesthetics as a new emerging art
          movement. While AI art remains restricted to evaluation via traditional means such as emotional impact and
          human aesthetics, it certainly pushes the bar between technology and art and creates a new method of
          experiencing art unlike any seen before: despite being birthed by algorithms modelling a human sense of
          creativity, AI art has an idiosyncratic style due to the influence of its computational origins. Furthermore,
          AI’s reach into further endeavours such as literature and music demonstrate the large variety of media
          encompassed within the field of creative AI. This all leads to the need of a new movement to emerge that is
          free from traditional constraints with a demand for new terminology and definitions, allowing for its growth
          into a potential new genre of media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to both its inhuman and contemporary nature, there are many doubters of the authenticity and therefore
          its validity of art created by AI. A significant cause of this is due to the aforementioned lack of human
          emotion achievable by a computer, an element considered by some as integral to art. Stemming from this,
          however, is the argument that AI lacks the intent to be creative, instead producing art because it is
          programmed to. The idea of quantity also feeds into this, with the thought that the potential speed and
          abundance of an AI’s production make its creations less valuable as art. Klingemann states: “Machines can
          produce so much output. But there’s only so much attention and time. The more you see, the more it wears off.
          ‘More’ is not necessarily something you want to achieve.” (Klingemann, 2018) While this is true, I believe an
          isolated work’s quality shouldn’t need to be defined by other works produced by the artist. As for intent,
          there are many examples of what is considered art being created accidentally and therefore without the
          intention to create it – the same intent that objectors believe is crucial to art. While these points are
          fair criticisms to the medium of AI art and understandably hinder engagement within some audiences, I don’t
          consider them enough to discredit AI art as an art form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another cause of the distaste surrounding AI art is the manifestation of the unease and suspicion of it held
          by many. There is a very real concern that AI is taking over our society and stealing our jobs, a worry that
          is also felt in the art world. Will human artists become irrelevant following the onslaught of AI-generated
          art that continues to grow? While I don’t think so, due to the human desire for empathy and connection to the
          artist through their work, there are many who do. During an interview with <i>Obvious</i> technical lead Hugo
          Caselles-Dupré, following the backlash to the recent 2018 auction of a piece of their work at Christie’s –
          the first substantial auction of its kind – he shared that a significant part of this negativity that the
          group received was the consequence of these concerns. He explained that “AI art is also revealing what people
          think about AI, revealing the fear and the misconception about AI.” (Caselles-Dupré, 2018)
        </p>
        <p>
          Our society’s technological growth has yet to reach a point where AI is being created autonomously, resulting
          in the need for constant human input is integral to an AI’s creation. This causes artists to consider the
          works produced by their AI’s to be collaborations, unwilling to give full credit to their programs – a
          reasonable choice due to the scope of their contribution. Due to the open-source nature of much independent
          AI experimentation, the question of ownership is highlighted. In the previously mentioned auction of a piece
          of AI art, the code used by <i>Obvious</i> was discovered to be the work of another artist who uploaded it
          online
          for all to use. While this act wasn’t technically illegal and was considered a great victory for the whole
          field of AI art, it has forced people to consider the consequences of the constant advancements in this
          department. Does the creator of an AI hold ownership over its creations?
        </p>

        <figure class="figure" id="figure-6">
          <img src="media/edmond.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 6">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"><a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="#figures">Figure 6</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <i>Obvious</i> nominated the image-set to act as an input for the GAN and decided upon the final solution via
          their
          own creative criteria. By doing this, <i>Obvious</i> is considered by some to be the creative drive behind
          the work,
          giving them ownership. However, in this same situation where we replace the AI with a traditional painter,
          the ownership of a completed work would lie with the artist, rather than the provider of the tools used to
          create art and the curator who selects which painting to display. This suggests that in a world where AI is
          treated as human, it would gain ownership of its work. <i>Obvious</i> agreed with this sentiment, at least to
          some
          extent, signing the auctioned work with the algorithm used to create it.

          A final intriguing consequence of the digital nature of art-producing machines is the absence of any
          limitation of
          potential inspiration for a computer. Human beings are only able to stretch their imaginations in relation to
          their education, knowledge and actual experience whereas, while computers are unable to gain real life
          experience, they can consume more media than would be possible for a human to in a lifetime, far exceeding
          the restrictions of human memory. This could add nuance to a computer’s creation that is unattainable to a
          human artist.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Regarding the question of whether computers can be creative, the answer is yes, at least in any measurable
          definition of the word. Artificial Intelligence is made to mimic human intelligence and it therefore produces
          work that has the potential of being as creative as its human counterpart. The only difference between this
          and a human artist’s creative output is the audience’s perception of the work, as many people struggle to
          have an emotional response to art when they cannot feel a connection to the creator through it. While there
          may be much controversy surrounding the medium of AI art, there is no doubt that many talented artists are
          utilising this technology to create fascinating works of art. Due to both this, the questions surrounding
          this emerging technology, such as the uncertainty of ownership as well as the scope of the possibilities
          inherent to the field of AI art, the need to consider it a valid art movement is clear. AI can enhance our
          practice, teach us more about our own work and even perform feats far beyond the abilities of a human. There
          is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence technology will only continue to become more sophisticated and it’s
          the artists job to employ it with the goal of expanding our creative horizons.
